        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) can refrigerated biscuits (such as Pillsbury Grands!)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Mozzarella cheese, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pepperoni, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Pop open the biscuit can and divide into 8 biscuits. Flatten each biscuit with your thumb into a 1/8-inch circle</li>
            <li>Spread the center of each circle with about 1 tablespoon Mozzarella cheese, and about 1 tablespoon pepperoni</li>
            <li>Pull up the edges of each circle to form a ball, and seal completely. Rol them into your hands to ensure the dough
                is sealed, then set each ball on the baking sheet, seal-side-down.</li>
            <li>Brush each ball with melted butter. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve with additional warmed pizza sauce for dipping.</li>
        </ol>
