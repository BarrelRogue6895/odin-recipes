            <p>When your taste buds crave crab, but you can't afford the real deal, these fried crab legs hit the spot.</p>
            <p>Look for the "leg style" imitation crab in the freezer section.</p>
            <p>The imitation crab tends to be on the sweet side, so I serve them with lemon wedges and cocktail sauce,</p>
            <p>but feel free to dip them in sweet chili sauce if you like things sweeter.</p>
        </div>
