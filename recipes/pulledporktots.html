        <p>Forget potato skins... have you ever had loaded Tater Tots? Tots are baked in muffin cups and transformed
             into crispy potato cups before being loaded with pulled pork, cheese, BBQ sauce, and sour cream. These bites
              are perfect for a party and also a great way to use up leftover pulled pork.</p></div>

       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cooking Spray</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots)</li>
                <li>8 ounces prepared pulled pork</li>
                <li>3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1/4 cup BBQ sauce</li>
                <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>3 medium green onions, chopped</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spray the cups of a 12-cup muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Place 4 to 5 frozen potato nuggets into each muffin cup.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove muffin pan from the oven. Using a small glass (juice glass or shot glass) twist and press the tots downward in 
                    each muffin cup to create a potato cup. Return to the oven and bake until deep golden brown, about 15 minutes</li>
                <li>Remove the pan from the oven and distribute pulled pork evenly between the cups. Add 1 tablespoon of shredded cheese
                    to each potato cup, being careful to try and keep it on top of the pulled pork (not down the sides of the muffin cup)</li>
                <li>Return to the oven and bake until the cheese has melted, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer the potato cups
                    to a serving platter</li>
                <li>Drizzle with BBQ sauce, add a small dollop of sour cream, and sprinkle with green onions before serving</li>
            </ol>
